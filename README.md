ðŸ’¹ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆThis repository contains some machine leaning task that I did in the year of `2023`.

1. [`00_LOADSHEDDING_IMPACT`](/00_LOADSHEDDING_IMPACT/README.md) - a predictive machine learning task using supervised and unsupervised clustering in predicting the effects of loadshedding to university students in south africa.
2. [`01_NSFAS_RS`](/01_NSFAS_RS/README.md)- a binary classification model using unsupervised machine leaning algorithm for label clustering and machine learning classification algorithm to classify the eligibility of a student to qualify for funding.
3. [`02_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION`](/02_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION/00_CUSTOMER_SEGMENTATION.ipynb)- Customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning clustering.
4. [`03_IMAGE_ROI_CLUSTERING`](/03_IMAGE_ROI_CLUSTERING/IMAGE_ROI.ipynb)- Clustering of images by extracting ` Region of Interest`` from images.
